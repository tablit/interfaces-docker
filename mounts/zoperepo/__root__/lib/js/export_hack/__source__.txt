// make vision_bundle_js a script instead of a module to have everything in
// in global JS namespace
// i know this is very sloppy, but as we inject user written JS into the page
// this is fine for now xD
// in the future we should consider implementing a proper module structure,
// the question will then be how to force users to write JS modules without
// them even noticing .. ?!
